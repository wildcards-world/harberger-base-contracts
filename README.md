# Harberger Tax Base Contracts

For more details on how to integrate this see [this article](https://dev.to/wildcards/build-your-first-harberger-tax-app-part-1-3gdd).

## Disclaimer:

USE THESE CONTRACTS AT YOUR OWN RISK. These are NOT the exact same contracts that are deployed to mainnet by wildcards.world.

## NOTE:

This is a public repo - the private keys in `secrectsManager.example.js` are NOT guaranteed to have test ether in them. Additionally, the infura keys are free tier, so rate limited. If they don't work, go and create your own infura keys!
